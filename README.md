# Idea
Our platform is designed to streamline food donation and distribution by connecting donors, agencies, and beneficiaries. It features user-friendly interfaces and robust functionality to ensure efficient management of donations while adhering to safety regulations and minimizing waste.

# Features
1. **Account Registration**: Donors and agencies can apply for accounts by providing basic information and entity certificates, which are reviewed and approved by the Food Bank.

3. **Donation Records**: Donors can view and manage their donation history, with detailed records accessible through their personal interface.
4. **Guidelines Access**: Donors can review GSFD Bill guidelines on a dedicated page to ensure compliance and encourage more donations.
5. **Beneficiary Account Creation**: Agencies create and manage accounts for beneficiaries, setting quotas based on their needs to control food allocation.
6. **Request Records Management**: Agencies monitor and access request records from beneficiaries under their management to track food distribution.
7. **Food Browsing**: Beneficiaries and agencies browse available food donations with filters for type, region, and allergens to easily find and select items.
8. **Food Requesting**: Beneficiaries and agencies request food by reviewing item details and submitting their requests, with confirmation messages for success or failure.
9. **Request History**: Beneficiaries can check their own request records and view detailed information for each entry.
10. **Quota and Account Information**: Beneficiaries can view their account details and remaining quota to manage their food requests within allocated limits.
